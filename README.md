# Neural Style Transfer

:warning: Work In Progress :warning:

## Installation

Execute the following command from the root of the repository to install the project:

```bash
    pip install -e .
```

**Note that this step is required to run the project.**

## Requirements

### Base Requirements

1. Python (3.7)
2. PyTorch (1.7)
3. Torchvision (0.8)
4. Tqdm - For displaying progress bars
5. [Weights and Biases](https://github.com/wandb/client) - For visualization

### Additional Requirements

[PyTorch-Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) (1.0) is required
for executing Fast Style Transfer.
